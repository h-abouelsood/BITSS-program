# BITSS-program
# Research Transparency Overview and Guidelines (in Arabic)
Catalyst: Heba Abou-El-Sood

One of the fundamental challenges towards transparency and reproducibility of research in the MENA region is a cultural barrier. Information regarding data input for research and outcomes (not yet publishable) have been always viewed in the lenses of secrecy, confidentiality, and competitive advantage. The research community in the MENA region needs to have content in their own language (Arabic), to be culturally embedded, and not superficially imposed or borrowed from other cultural backgrounds. This project aims to achieve this end goal by providing culturally adapted concepts, guidelines, and translation of material to appeal to the research community and facilitate/motivate adoption and execution.
